                    Throughout my academic, co-curricular and professional experiences, I have gained practical skills in
                    building and testing software using a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
                    I'm particularly interested in the intersection of software engineering, AI, and cloud technologies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I'm currently working as a <strong>Graduate Software Engineer at Kainos</strong>, where I'm contributing
                    to a public sector project using the .NET stack. My role thus far has involved developing new features, fixing bugs,
                    and refactoring existing code with a focus on Test Driven Development.
                    As part of this role, I am taking part in the Kainos Early Careers program, which has included attending a 3 week Software Engineering Academy
                    where we learned about industry best practices, agile methodologies, N-tier architecture along with the components of each layer, and many other items. 
                    To wrap it all together we took part in mock sprints at the end of each week to simulate real world software development scenarios and to reinforce our learning throughout the week.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Whether it's a new programming language, AI/ML tool, library or framework, I'm 
                    always eager to expand my knowledge and I thrive on exploring and learning about 
                    new technologies.
